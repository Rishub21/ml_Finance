Various machine learning tools to predict and analyze stock movements

1) LSTM_rationet.py : Takes ticker of any company in S&P500 as an argument. Uses Long Short Term Memory Neural Network to predict stock prices based on historical prices and ratios. rationet.py does the same thing but it uses a feed forward neural network and is not as accurate

2) returnsCalc.py : Takes ticker of any company in S&P500 as an argument. Uses ensemble learning to predict buy, hold, or sell signal based on the movements of all the other stocks in the S&P500 

3) kerasPrediction.py: Same as LSTM_rationet.py but only uses prices to predict prices.
